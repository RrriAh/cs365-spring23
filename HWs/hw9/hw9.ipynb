    "Instead of computing the derivative of a function, we can also estimate the gradient numerically with various methods. These methods are essential, especially when a callable function is not exposed due to privacy reasons, or it is hard to differentiate analytically. \n",
    "\n",
    "To numerically compute the gradient, the simple way is to follow Newton's difference quotient: $f'(x)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}{f(x+h)-f(x)\\over h}$. Another two-point formula is to compute the slope through the points $(x-h,f(x-h))$ and $(x+h,f(x+h))$. Let us reuse the example function $f(x)=2x^2-3x+\\ln x$ and test the precision of these two approaches. Define the function in the next cell, and try to compute its gradient via both methods at $x=2$. Range h value in [0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001] and report all gradients calculated. Which method is more accurate, and why does it work better?"

The probability of having $y=1$ is modeled as $$P_y={1\\over 1+e^{-(b_0+b_1\\cdot x_1+\\dots +b_m\\cdot x_m)}}={1\\over 1+e^{-(b_0+\\vec{b}_{1:m}\\cdot\\vec{x})}}$$\n",

    "Once we know how to compute the gradients, we can optimize the objective, which is log-likelihood in our case, using gradient descent. It iteratively changes the parameters in a small \"step\" towards the gradient direction, i.e., the direction where the objective increases at the fastest pace. Formally, denote the calculated gradients as $\\Delta (\\vec{b})$, we can update our parameters via $\\vec{b}=\\vec{b}+\\gamma \\cdot \\Delta (\\vec{b})$, where $\\gamma$ is the size of the \"step\". Repeat this process until the objective stop improving or a pre-set max number of iterations is reached. **Note in practice, the value of gradient changes over iterations and can be very large/small, so you should normalize the gradient vector every iteration, i.e., scale it to $\\Delta (\\vec{b})\\over ||\\Delta (\\vec{b})||_2$, before using it to compute the new $\\vec{b}$.
