    "This notebook aims to empirically investigate the properties of Erdős-Rényi graphs, specifically the $G(n,p)$ model, and compare them with real-world networks. Networkx provides a convenient way to generate random graphs using built-in functions for various commonly used graph models. To create an Erdős-Rényi graph, we can use the function `nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n, p)`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `p` is the probability of an edge between two nodes. The function returns an `nx.Graph` object containing the nodes and edges of the generated graph.\n"

    "In the upcoming code cell, you will be requested to generate graphs from $G(n,p)$ model with $n$ set to 100, using different values of $p$ ranging from 0.001 to 0.081, with a small step size such as 0.005. For each value of $p$, you should generate 10 graph samples from the model and report the average of the following graph statistics with error bars for std. We also provide a brief explanation on how to compute these statistics using networkx functions:\n",

    "- Number of edges: To obtain the number of edges in a given nx.graph object G, you can utilize the function `G.number_of_edges()`.\n",

To calculate the total number of triangles in G, simply sum all the values in the dictionary and divide the result by 3 (since each triangle is counted three times in the dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of isolated nodes: If a node has degree 0, then it is an isolated node. The function G.degree is a map-like object consisting of (node id, node degree) pairs. To count the number of isolated nodes, iterate through `G.degree` and count the number of 0s in the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of connected components: In graph theory, a connected component is a set of vertices in a graph that are linked to each other by paths. Using nx.connected_components(G), a node list generator is returned, which yields one component at a time. To get the total number of connected components, you can use `len(list(nx.connected_components(G)))`.\n",
